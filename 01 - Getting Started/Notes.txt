= println! calls a Rust macro
  = if it called a function instead, it would be entered as println(without !).
= using a ! means that you're calling a macro instead of a normal function.
= Rust is an ahead-of-time compiled language, meaning you can compile a program 
  and give the executable to someone else and they can run it even without rust 
  installed.
= Cargo is Rust's build system and package manager.
= Cargo handles a lot of tasks for you such as building your code, downloading 
  the libraries your code depends on, and building those libraries.
= We call libraries that your code needs dependencies.
= To set up a new project using cargo:

    $ cargo new hello_cargo
    $ cd hello_cargo

= After you create the cargo directory's project, there's a TOML file which is
  a Tom's obvious Minimal language.
= [package] is a section heading that indicates that the following statements 
  are configuring a package.
= You can also add author name for your .toml files on [package] section:

    authors = ["your name <you@example.com>"];

= [dependencies] is section for you to list any of your projects dependencies.
= In Rust, packages of code are referred to as crates.
= To compile your code using cargo:

    $ cargo build

= To compile and run your code:

    $ cargo run

= To check if your code was compiled but doenst produce an executable program:

    $ cargo check

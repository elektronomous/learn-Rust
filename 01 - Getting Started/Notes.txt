= println! calls a Rust macro
  = if it called a function instead, it would be entered as println(without !).

= Rust is an ahead-of-time compiled language, meaning you can compile a program and give the executable

= Cargo is Rust's build system and package manager.
= Cargo handles a lot of tasks for you such as building your code, downloading the libraries your code
